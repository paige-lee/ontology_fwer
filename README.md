The "Ontology code.ipynb" Jupyter notebook file is not the most up to date. The most updated version is greater than 25 MB, so it's too large to be uploaded.

The "8 experiments.ipynb" Jupyter notebook contains the code that generated 3,200 repeats of the parameter estimation and permutation testing algorithm. 4 cases * 8 experiments * 100 repeats = 3,200 repeats in total.
