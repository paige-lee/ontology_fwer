The "Ontology code.ipynb" Jupyter notebook file is not the most up to date. The most updated version is greater than 25 MB, so it's too large to be uploaded.

The "8 experiments.ipynb" Jupyter notebook contains the code that generated 3,200 repeats of the parameter estimation and permutation testing algorithm. 4 cases * 8 experiments * 100 repeats = 3,200 repeats in total.

The "Calculating false positive rate.ipynb" Jupyter notebook contains code that calculates the false positive rate of each case/experiment combination for cases 1, 2, and 4.
